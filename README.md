# PRS：A Software Package for Parallel Ranking and Selection Procedures


PRS includes three popular parallel R&S procedures, i.e., the good selection procedure (**GSP**) proposed by [ Ni et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2016.1577), the knockout-tournament (**KT**) procedure proposed by [ Zhong and Hong (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2020.2065), and the fixed-budget knockout-tournament (**FBKT**) procedure proposed by [ Hong et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2022.1221).
